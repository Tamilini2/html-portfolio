<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Tamilini Paskaran. I am 30 years old from The Netherlands. I was born and raised in the 3rd biggest city
  of the Netherlands called, The Hague. My roots is Sri Lankan Tamil.

  I'd describe myself as a world citizen. My love for traveling started when I moved abroad.
   After my 24th, I moved to the UK for my masters degree. After 2 years living in London I returned back to
  Netherlands and starting working full-time as an Quality Assurance IT consultant. In the same year I had an opportunity to move
  to Madrid in Spain for a project. I was hesistant, but looking back I am glad I took the opportunity. It taught me so many lessons in life.
  As no suprise, I love to travel. Meeting new people, cultures, food and history has always fascinated me. It gives me bigger 
  prospective of life.  </p>

<p>Besides traveling, I play badminton several times a week. But I love to do the most is dancing. Although since I am 30 my body is not that flexible as it used to be before.
  Technology, spirtuality, health and psychology are topics what I am interested in. This is my first time creating a website even though I was interested in the world of IT from
  a young age. However, due to circumstances I did pursue this serious further, but hey it's never too late!
